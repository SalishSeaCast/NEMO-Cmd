.. _NEMO-CmdPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3.11/
    :alt: Python Version

The :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package is developed using `Python`_ 3.11.
The minimum supported Python version is 3.8.
The :ref:`NEMO-CmdContinuousIntegration` workflow on GitHub ensures that the package
is tested for all versions of Python>=3.8.
An old version of the package running under Python 3.5 is depoloyed on the
Westgrid :kbd:`orcinus` HPC platform.
That version is tagged in the repository as ``orcinus-python-3.5``.

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/


.. _NEMO-CmdGettingTheCode:

Getting the Code
================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20control-git-blue.svg?logo=github
    :target: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd
    :alt: Git on GitHub

Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub with:

.. _repository: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd.git


.. _NEMO-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called ``nemo-cmd`` that will have
all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands below.

.. _Conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd NEMO-Cmd
    $ conda env create -f envs/environment-dev.yaml
    $ conda activate nemo-cmd

:kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` is installed in `editable install mode`_ as part of the conda environment
creation process.
That means that the package is installed from the cloned repo via symlinks so that
it will be automatically updated as the repo evolves.

.. _editable install mode: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nemo-cmd)$ conda deactivate


.. _NEMO-CmdCodingStyle:

Coding Style
============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg
    :target: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    :alt: The uncompromising Python code formatter

The :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package uses the `black`_ code formatting tool to maintain a coding style that is very close to `PEP 8`_.

.. _black: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
.. _PEP 8: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

:command:`black` is installed as part of the :ref:`NEMO-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment` setup.

To run :command:`black` on the entire code-base use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd NEMO-Cmd
    $ conda activate nemo-cmd
    (nemo-cmd)$ black ./

in the repository root directory.
The output looks something like::

  reformatted /media/doug/warehouse/MEOPAR/NEMO-Cmd/nemo_cmd/fspath.py

.. _NEMO-CmdBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/nemo-cmd/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://nemo-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    :alt: Documentation Status

The documentation for the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package is written in `reStructuredText`_ and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.

.. _reStructuredText: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

If you have write access to the `repository`_ on GitHub,
whenever you push changes to GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://nemo-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Additions,
improvements,
and corrections to these docs are *always* welcome.

The quickest way to fix typos, etc. on existing pages is to use the :guilabel:`Edit on GitHub` link in the upper right corner of the page to get to the online editor for the page on `GitHub`_.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd

For more substantial work,
and to add new pages,
follow the instructions in the :ref:`NEMO-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment` section above.
In the development environment you can build the docs locally instead of having to push commits to GitHub to trigger a `build on readthedocs.org`_ and wait for it to complete.
Below are instructions that explain how to:

.. _build on readthedocs.org: https://readthedocs.org/projects/nemo-cmd/builds/

* build the docs with your changes,
  and preview them in Firefox

* check the docs for broken links


.. _NEMO-CmdBuildingAndPreviewingTheDocumentation:

Building and Previewing the Documentation
-----------------------------------------

Building the documentation is driven by the :file:`docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`mohid-cmd` development environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nemo-cmd)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like::

  build succeeded.

  The HTML pages are in _build/html.

The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`NEMO-Cmd/docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser to preview the results of the build before committing and pushing your changes to GitHub.

Whenever you push changes to the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` repository on GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://nemo-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


.. _NEMO-CmdLinkCheckingTheDocumentation:

Link Checking the Documentation
-------------------------------

.. image:: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd/workflows/sphinx-linkcheck/badge.svg
    :target: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd/actions?query=workflow%3A
    :alt: Sphinx linkcheck

Sphinx also provides a link checker utility which can be run to find broken or redirected links in the docs.
With your :kbd:`nemo-cmd` environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (mohid-cmd)$ cd NEMO-Cmd/docs/
    (mohid-cmd) docs$ make linkcheck

The output looks something like::

Running the Unit Tests
======================

The test suite for the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package is in :file:`NEMO-Cmd/tests/`.
The `pytest`_ tools is used for test fixtures and as the test runner for the suite.

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

With your :kbd:`nemo-cmd` development environment activated,
use:

.. _Mercurial: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ cd NEMO-Cmd/
    (salishsea-cmd)$ pytest

to run the test suite.
The output looks something like::

The test coverage report will be displayed below the test suite run output.

Alternatively,
you can use

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ pytest --cov=./ --cov-report html

to produce an HTML report that you can view in your browser by opening :file:`NEMO-Cmd/htmlcov/index.html`.
