.. _NEMO-CmdPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.5+-blue.svg
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3.7/
    :alt: Python Version

The :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package is developed and tested using `Python`_ 3.7.
However,
the package must also run under `Python`_ 3.5 for use on the Westgrid :kbd:`orcinus` HPC platform.


.. _NEMO-CmdGettingTheCode:

Getting the Code
================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20control-hg-blue.svg
    :target: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-cmd/
    :alt: Mercurial on Bitbucket

Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from Bitbucket with:

.. _repository: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-cmd/

.. code-block:: bash

    $ hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-cmd/

or

.. code-block:: bash

    $ hg clone https://<your_userid>@bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-cmd/

if you don't have `ssh key authentication`_ set up on Bitbucket.

.. _ssh key authentication: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-ssh-for-mercurial-728138122.html


.. _NEMO-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have `Anaconda Python Distribution`_ or `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called :kbd:`nemo-cmd` that will have all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands:

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/
.. _Conda: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/
.. _Anaconda Python Distribution: http://www.continuum.io/downloads
.. _Miniconda3: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd NEMO-Cmd
    $ conda env create -f env/environment-dev.yaml
    $ source activate nemo-cmd
    (nemo-cmd)$ pip install --editable .

The :kbd:`--editable` option in the :command:`pip install` commands above installs the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package from the repository clone via symlinks so that :program:`nemo` command in the :kbd:`nemo-cmd` environment will be automatically updated as the repo evolves.

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nemo-cmd)$ source deactivate


.. _NEMO-CmdCodingStyle:

Coding Style
============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg
    :target: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    :alt: The uncompromising Python code formatter

The :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package uses the `black`_ code formatting tool to maintain a coding style that is very close to `PEP 8`_.

.. _black: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
.. _PEP 8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

:command:`black` is installed as part of the :ref:`NEMO-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment` setup.

To run :command:`black` on the entire code-base use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd NEMO-Cmd
    $ conda activate nemo-cmd
    (nemo-cmd)$ black ./

in the repository root directory.
The output looks something like::

  reformatted /media/doug/warehouse/MEOPAR/NEMO-Cmd/nemo_cmd/fspath.py
  reformatted /media/doug/warehouse/MEOPAR/NEMO-Cmd/tests/test_api.py

  6 files reformatted, 14 files left unchanged.


.. _NEMO-CmdBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/nemo-cmd/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://nemo-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    :alt: Documentation Status

The documentation for the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package is written in `reStructuredText`_ and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.
Creating a :ref:`NEMO-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment` as described above includes the installation of Sphinx.
Building the documentation is driven by :file:`tools/docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`nemo-cmd` development environment activated,
use:

.. _reStructuredText: http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/

.. code-block:: bash

    (nemo-cmd)$ cd tools
    (nemo-cmd)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like::

  rm -rf _build/*
  sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html
  Running Sphinx v1.5.1
  making output directory...
  loading pickled environment... not yet created

  copying extra files... done
  dumping search index in English (code: en) ... done
  dumping object inventory... done
  build succeeded.

  Build finished. The HTML pages are in _build/html.

The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`NEMO-Cmd/docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser to preview the results of the build before committing and pushing your changes to Bitbucket.

Whenever you push changes to the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` repository on Bitbucket the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://nemo-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


.. _NEMO-CmdRuningTheUnitTests:

Running the Unit Tests
======================

The test suite for the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package is in :file:`NEMO-Cmd/tests/`.
The `pytest`_ tools is used for test fixtures and as the test runner for the suite.

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

With your :kbd:`nemo-cmd` development environment activated,
use:

.. _Mercurial: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ cd NEMO-Cmd/
    (salishsea-cmd)$ py.test

to run the test suite.
The output looks something like::

  =========================== test session starts =============================
  platform linux -- Python 3.6.1, pytest-3.0.5, py-1.4.32, pluggy-0.4.0
  rootdir: /media/doug/warehouse/MEOPAR/NEMO-Cmd, inifile:

You can monitor what lines of code the test suite exercises using the `coverage.py`_ tool with the command:

.. _coverage.py: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ cd NEMO-Cmd/
    (salishsea-cmd)$ coverage run -m py.test

and generate a test coverage report with:

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ coverage report

to produce a plain text report,
or

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-cmd)$ coverage html

to produce an HTML report that you can view in your browser by opening :file:`NEMO-Cmd/htmlcov/index.html`.


Continuous Integration
----------------------

The :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package unit test suite is run and a coverage report is generated whenever changes are pushed to Bitbucket.
The results are visible on the `repo pipelines page`_,
from the :guilabel:`Builds` column on the `repo commits page`_,
or from a link in the build status area on the right side of the `repo summary page`_ .

.. _repo pipelines page: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-cmd/addon/pipelines/home
.. _repo commits page: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-cmd/commits/all
.. _repo summary page: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-cmd/


Pipelines Container Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Bitbucket pipelines configuration in :file:`bitbucket-pipelines.yml` uses a custom image that includes a :command:`conda` environment for running the test wuite with coverage analysis.
The image is defined and maintained using the :file:`Dockerfile` and :file:`environment-test.yaml` files in the :file:`pipelines-test-env/` directory.

To build or update the image and push it to Docker Hub use:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker build -t nemo-cmd-test pipelines-test-env/
    docker tag nemo-cmd-test:latest douglatornell/salishsea:nemo-cmd-test
    docker push douglatornell/salishsea:nemo-cmd-test
