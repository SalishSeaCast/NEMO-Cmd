.. _NEMO-CmdPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/python/required-version-toml?tomlFilePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd/main/pyproject.toml&logo=Python&logoColor=gold&label=Python
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3/
    :alt: Python Version from PEP 621 TOML

The :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package is developed using `Python`_ 3.14.
The minimum supported Python version is 3.11.
The :ref:`NEMO-CmdContinuousIntegration` workflow on GitHub ensures that the package
is tested for all versions of Python>=3.11.
An old version of the package running under Python 3.5 is deployed on the
Westgrid :kbd:`orcinus` HPC platform.
That version is tagged in the repository as ``orcinus-python-3.5``.

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/


.. _NEMO-CmdGettingTheCode:

Getting the Code
================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20control-git-blue.svg?logo=github
    :target: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd
    :alt: Git on GitHub

Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub with:

.. _repository: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd.git


.. _NEMO-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called ``nemo-cmd`` that will have
all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands below.

.. _Conda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd NEMO-Cmd
    $ conda env create -f envs/environment-dev.yaml
    $ conda activate nemo-cmd

:kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` is installed in `editable install mode`_ as part of the conda environment
creation process.
That means that the package is installed from the cloned repo via symlinks so that
it will be automatically updated as the repo evolves.

.. _editable install mode: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs

To deactivate the environment use:

Coding Style
============

    :target: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    :alt: The uncompromising Python code formatter

The ``NEMO-Cmd`` package uses Git pre-commit hooks managed by `pre-commit`_ to
maintain consistent code style and and other aspects of code,
docs,
and repo QA.

.. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/

To install the `pre-commit` hooks in a newly cloned repo,
activate the conda development environment,
and run :command:`pre-commit install`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd NEMO-Cmd
    $ conda activate nemo-cmd
    (nemo-cmd)$ pre-commit install

.. note::
    You only need to install the hooks once immediately after you make a new clone
    of the `NEMO-Cmd repository`_ and build your :ref:`NEMO-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment`.

.. _NEMO-CmdBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

.. image:: https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/nemo-cmd/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://nemo-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    :alt: Documentation Status

The documentation for the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package is written in `reStructuredText`_ and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.

.. _reStructuredText: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

If you have write access to the `repository`_ on GitHub,
whenever you push changes to GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://nemo-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Additions,
improvements,
and corrections to these docs are *always* welcome.

The quickest way to fix typos, etc. on existing pages is to use the :guilabel:`Edit on GitHub` link in the upper right corner of the page to get to the online editor for the page on `GitHub`_.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd

For more substantial work,
and to add new pages,
follow the instructions in the :ref:`NEMO-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment` section above.
In the development environment you can build the docs locally instead of having to push commits to GitHub to trigger a `build on readthedocs.org`_ and wait for it to complete.
Below are instructions that explain how to:

.. _build on readthedocs.org: https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/nemo-cmd/builds/

* build the docs with your changes,
  and preview them in Firefox

* check the docs for broken links


.. _NEMO-CmdBuildingAndPreviewingTheDocumentation:

Building and Previewing the Documentation
-----------------------------------------

Building the documentation is driven by the :file:`docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`nemo-cmd` development environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nemo-cmd)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like:

.. code-block:: text

    The HTML pages are in _build/html.

The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`NEMO-Cmd/docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser to preview the results of the build before committing and pushing your changes to GitHub.

Whenever you push changes to the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` repository on GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://nemo-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


.. _NEMO-CmdLinkCheckingTheDocumentation:

Link Checking the Documentation
-------------------------------

    :target: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd/actions?query=workflow:sphinx-linkcheck
    :alt: Sphinx linkcheck

Sphinx also provides a link checker utility which can be run to find broken or redirected links in the docs.
With your :kbd:`nemo-cmd` environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (mohid-cmd)$ cd NEMO-Cmd/docs/
    (mohid-cmd) docs$ make linkcheck

The output looks something like:

Releases are done at Doug's discretion when significant pieces of development work have been
completed.

The release process steps are:

#. Use :command:`hatch version release` to bump the version from ``.devn`` to the next release
   version identifier

#. Edit :file:`docs/CHANGES.rst` to update the version identifier and replace ``unreleased``
   with the release date

#. Commit the version bump and change log update

#. Create and annotated tag for the release with :guilabel:`Git -> New Tag...` in PyCharm
   or :command:`git tag -e -a vyy.n`

#. Push the version bump commit and tag to GitHub

#. Use the GitHub web interface to create a release,
   editing the auto-generated release notes into sections:

   * Features
   * Bug Fixes
   * Documentation
   * Maintenance
   * Dependency Updates

#. Use the GitHub :guilabel:`Issues -> Milestones` web interface to edit the release
   milestone:

   * Change the :guilabel:`Due date` to the release date
   * Delete the "when it's ready" comment in the :guilabel:`Description`

#. Use the GitHub :guilabel:`Issues -> Milestones` web interface to create a milestone for
   the next release:

   * Set the :guilabel:`Title` to the next release version,
     prepended with a ``v``;
     e.g. ``v23.1``
   * Set the :guilabel:`Due date` to the end of the year of the next release
   * Set the :guilabel:`Description` to something like
     ``v23.1 release - when it's ready :-)``
   * Create the next release milestone

#. Review the open issues,
   especially any that are associated with the milestone for the just released version,
   and update their milestone.

#. Close the milestone for the just released version.

#. Use :command:`hatch version minor,dev` to bump the version for the next development cycle,
   or use :command:`hatch version major,minor,dev` for a year rollover version bump

#. Edit :file:`docs/CHANGES.rst` to add a new section for the unreleased dev version

#. Commit the version bump and change log update

#. Push the version bump commit to GitHub
