# nemo command processor run description example for NEMO-3.6
# running on a computecanada.ca system like cedar or graham

# Name of the NEMO-3.6 configuration to use for the run;
# i.e. your NEMO-3.6-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG/ configuration directory
config name: GYRE_OFF

# How is the domain to be distributed over the processors in the
# i and j grid directions?
# These values are used to set the nammpp namelist jpni & jpnj values
# and to set the number of processors and nodes in the PBS script
MPI decomposition: 2x3

# The run_id value appears in the list of jobs display by the squeue command
run_id: gyre_TRC

# Maximum run time requested/allowed for job
# Too low and you job will be terminated before it finishes
# Too high and you will have to wait longer on the queue for your job to start
# You have to experiment to find the "just right" value
walltime: 0:10:00

# Email address to send job begin, end, and abort notifications to
email: you@example.com

# Account name to charge resources used by the job to
account: def-allen
