This an extensible tool built on the OpenStack ``cliff``
(`Command Line Interface Formulation Framework`_)
package.
As such,
it can be used as the basis for a NEMO domain-specific command processor tool.

.. _Command Line Interface Formulation Framework: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/cliff/

The ``NEMO-Cmd`` is based on v2.2 of the SalishSeaCast NEMO model project's
``tools/SalishSeaCmd`` package.
